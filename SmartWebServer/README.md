# OnStep Smart Web Server
This is the WiFi and Ethernet web server for OnStep, it is also sometimes referred to as the "SWS".
The SWS enables OnStep to be controlled from a website and/or by passing commands over IP.
The SWS is known to work from personal computers (using a web browser, ASCOM, or INDI), phones (Android and iOS), tablets, and the wireless Smart Hand Controller.

# Optionally, the SWS can also provide:
Support for encoders where it integrates tightly with OnStep; or if not using Encoders, OnStepX can use those four connections (pins) as general purpose I/O.
There is also support for using the "ACGAM R1 Bluetooth 4.0 Wireless Gamepad" over Bluetooth LE which you can read about here:
